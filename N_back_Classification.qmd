## Data Manipulation

The data set used in this study is retrieved from the website of [Tufts HCI Lab](https://tufts-hci-lab.github.io/code_and_datasets/fNIRS2MW.html).

In the wide form of the data set we have 6818 observations from each of 68 subjects. The observations are ordered according to each n-back condition (*0→1→2→3→1→2→3→0→2→3→0→1→3→0→1→2*). The order of the task is the same for all subjects.

The first 10 observations on all columns are given as:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
wide_form <- read.csv("wide.form.csv")
wide_form %>%
  slice(1:10)
```
